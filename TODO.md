# Must haves

- [x] Create mocks for the back-end
- [x] Show a list of services in a modal when clicking on "x services"
- [x] Update to show "x services" again rather than "expand"
- [x] Remove extra code from all_locations related to stacks details (not needed anymore)
- [x] Add links to jump between pages
- [ ] Create a modal for Shivam's graphs when clicking on energy efficiency in all_locations.html
- [ ] Add an explanation that analysis is of your current stack, and all_locations compares all available data centers.

- [x] Create links at the top right between the two pages
- [x] In analysis, show all suggested options and draw lines to them to show what is being compared
- [ ] In analysis comparison, use name of region instead of region code as label
- [x] Also compare with less efficient regions, always show comparison
- [ ] Overall score based on all data centers

- [x] Edit current text to say "stack" instead of "service"
- [x] In analysis.html, show all data centers as circles on the generic map
- [x] In analysis.html, color code data center circles depending on their relative carbon efficiency
- [x] In analysis.html, show extra information about a stack when clicking on it's circle on the map
- [x] In the analysis, show a circle around the selected data center
- [x] In the analysis, show a list of better data centers when a data center is selected
- [ ] Write more todos
- [ ] ????
- [ ] Profit


# Questions

- Make getRatingForStack real or improve mock?
- Problem with mercator projection :/
- How do we calculate efficiency?
  - worst -> best
  - best x percent

    Describe the problem you are trying to solve
    Describe what your project does exactly in layperson's terms
    Describe how it uses the API/SDK
    Describe how impactful it might be in terms of reduction and reach (in your case low reduction but high reach, in other words, running one API request through your proxy would make a very small total reduction in CO2 emissions, but the amount of API requests is gigantic, so it could add up to a massive impact)
    Describe how feasible it is for you to get to a production ready state with a bit of time or prize money; how feasible it would be for others to implement, and how likely it is that they would choose to use your tool if made available
    Describe what is your vision for how the solution you have started to build in this hackathon could make a difference to the world.
